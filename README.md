# About
Pixel Dungeon Editor is my first try of creating program which uses graphical component. It was written in C++ using framework Qt. 
The program has nothing to do with official Pixel Dungeon mobile game! It is rather an imitation of the official game's setting.
(Though textures were brazenly stolen.) Pixel Dungeon Editor is a joke map editor for unexisting game, where you can create rooms, 
connect them among each other and fill them with different stuff.
