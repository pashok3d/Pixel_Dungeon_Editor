# Pixel Dungeon Editor 1.0
Temporary Release Exe Repository (to be replaced by Release Exe Version and Source Version after global update)
# About
Pixel Dungeon Editor is my first try of creating program which uses graphical component. It was written in C++ using framework Qt. 
The program has nothing to do with official Pixel Dungeon game (http://pixeldungeon.watabou.ru)! It is rather an imitation of the official game's setting.
(Though textures were brazenly stolen.) Pixel Dungeon Editor is a joke map editor for unexisting game, where you can create rooms, 
connect them among each other and fill them with different stuff.
# How to run
- Download ZIP
- Extract wherever you want
- Run Project_3_NewEra_2.exe
# What is still wrong

- Undo/Redo are not avaliable (not implemented)
# Good to know
Probably Pixel Dungeon Editor 2.0 will be released on my official profile with following changes:
- Global code redraft
- Unavaliable functions will be finally implemented
- Check https://github.com/pashok3d for any updates on the topic
