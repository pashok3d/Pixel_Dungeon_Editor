# Pixel Dungeon Editor 1.0 Win
Tiled map editor for a pixel game, inspired by [Pixel Dungeon](http://pixeldungeon.watabou.ru).
# About
Pixel Dungeon Editor is my first try of creating program which uses graphical component. It was written in C++ using framework Qt. 
The program has nothing to do with official [Pixel Dungeon](http://pixeldungeon.watabou.ru) game! It is rather an imitation of the official game's setting.
Pixel Dungeon Editor is a joke map editor for unexisting game, where you can create rooms, 
connect them and fill with different stuff.
